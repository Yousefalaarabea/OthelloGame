About Othello
 Othello is a strategy board game for two players,
 played on an 8×8 uncheckered board. Two players
 compete, using 64 identical game pieces ("disks")
 that are white on one side and black on the other.
 Each player chooses one color to use throughout
 the game. Players take turns placing one disk on an
 empty square, with their assigned color facing up.
 After a play is made, any disks of the opponent's
 color that lie in a straight line bounded by the one
 just played and another one in the current player's
 color are turned over. When all playable empty
 squares are filled, the player with more disks
 showing in their own color wins the game
 GameSetup
 ● Initially, the board is set up by placing two black disks and
 two white disks at the center of the board exactly as shown
 in the opposite figure. The game always begins with this
 setup.
 ● Then, the remaining 60 disks are divided between players
 such that each player has 30 disks.
 Howthegamegoes
 1. Whenit’s a player’s turn, he must look for an empty square on the board that is adjacent
 to one of the opponent’s pieces. The player can add his disk there with his color facing
 upwards.
 2. If the newly added disk encloses a straight horizontal row or vertical column of the
 opponent’s pieces between two disks of the player’s color, then it’s a legal move known
 as “outflanking”
